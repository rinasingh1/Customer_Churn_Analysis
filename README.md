# Customer_Churn_Analysis (using Jupyter Notebook)
Python

# Objective
There is the company that wants to know the churn rate of it’s customers. 

## Data cleaning and Processing
•	In the “TotalCharges” column the blanks are replaced with 0 as tenure is 0 and no total charges are yet recorded – replace()
<br>

•	In the “SeniorCitizen” column 0 and 1 are converted into  no/yes. Using Conditional Statement (IF Clause).

## Dataset 
<a href = "https://github.com/rinasingh1/Customer_Churn_Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Churn.csv">View Customer Churn Dataset <a/> This project is based on 7043 data points.

## Project Insights 
•	Total number of churned customers out of 7042 is 1860 which is 26.54%. 
<br>

•	The churn rate of females(13.33%) is slightly  higher than that of males (13.20%)
<br>

•	The total number of senior citizens in this dataset is 1143, but their churn rate is very high that is 476 (41.68%). 
<br>

•	Those customers having engaged with the company's services for a longer term churn less than those being engaged for one or two months only.
<br>

•	The customers using “Electronic Check” as their payment method churn more.
<br>

•	The customers using company’s Online Services particularly, online security, device protection, online backup, tech support churn less. 

## Conclusion : 
•	It is seen that those customers being engaged with the company for one or two years, stay with the company for a longer terms, so the company should provide those services to the customers which keep them engaged with the company for a longer period, like it’s online services at the initial stage of the customer engagements with the company.
<br>

•	The company should look into the payment method of "electronic check" to know why the customers using this method, churn more and at the same time provide them those payment methods which are considered favourable by the customers such as credit card(automatic), bank transfer(automatic).
<br>

•	The company should pay special attention to their senior citizen customers to ensure them with their online security services while offering them these services at an affordable rate.
